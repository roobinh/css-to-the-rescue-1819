		<!--
		Restaurant Menu

		Idea: Front page with lots of different kinds of food, where you can choose from.
		Purpose: Getting inspiration on where to eat when not knowing what you want. :)

		Restrictions to project:
			•It has to be responsive without using @media queries
			•The design responds to language setting.
