## 1. The Assignment
In this course we are going to make a web page using only CSS and HTML. I had to choose between multiple given assignments, and chose for the **'Responsive Restaurant Menu'** for a restaurant called 'Burgertent'.

I had to choose two of the given **restrictions**, and chose for: 
- Two Colours
- CSS file less than 5Kb

Besides that, I was also 
- not allowed to use any ID's and Classes

so this is going to be fun :)

## 2. Learning goals
After this project, I am capable of the following things:

- Understanding the broader scope of css: You can show that css can be used for more than just styling web pages.
- You can understand the progressive enhancement parts of css: you can show that you can use the cascade, inheritance and specificity in your project. 
- You understand the interactive parts of css: Is the UX fully enhanced within the given CSS scope?
- You have been experimenting: Have the learning goals been stretched?

## 3. Progressive Enhancement parts
During this project, I learned a lot about progressive enhancement.

## 7. Closure
Starting with the project, I had (almost) no experience with CSS. This project was a challenge for me, but I think I learned a lot:
- I experimented a lot; what happens if i do this or that. I learned a lot from experimenting with all the different things possible in CSS.
- I learned how to make a responsive website using flexbox.
- I learned how to animate things within CSS
- I learned about progressive enhancement, how to make a website responsible on all possible platforms and browsers.
- I learned how to make a page interactive using CSS only.
