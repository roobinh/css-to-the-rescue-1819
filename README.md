## 1. The Assignment
In this course we are going to make a web page using only CSS and HTML. I had to choose between multiple given assignments, and chose for the **'Responsive Restaurant Menu'** for a restaurant called 'Burgertent'.

I had to choose two of the given **restrictions**, and chose for: 
- Two Colours
- CSS file less than 5Kb

Besides that, I was also 
- not allowed to use any ID's and Classes

so this is going to be fun :)

## 2. Learning goals
After this project, I am capable of the following things:

- Understanding the broader scope of css: You can show that css can be used for more than just styling web pages.
- You can understand the progressive enhancement parts of css: you can show that you can use the cascade, inheritance and specificity in your project. 
- You understand the interactive parts of css: Is the UX fully enhanced within the given CSS scope?
- You have been experimenting: Have the learning goals been stretched?

## 3. Progressive Enhancement parts
Defenition of progressive enhancement is: "User experience and cross-compatibility across all browsers". This is a very important part of making a website because you want your site to be able to reachable from as many devices as possible (if not all).

Progressive enhancements can be seperated into 3 different subjects:
- Cascade is a mechanism for determining which style should be applied to a given element. Cascade takes importance, origin, specificity and source order into account.

- Inherritance is the process by which elements inherit the the values of properties from their parents in the DOM tree. For instance: some properties, e.g. color, are automatically inherited by the children of the element to which they are applied.

- Specificity is a method of conflict resolution within the cascade. Specificity is calculated in a very special way. First, you write down the letters ABCD. 
-A is equal to 1 if the declaration comes from a style attribute in HTML (rather than in css file)
-B is equal to the number of ID attributes in a selector
-C is equal to the number of other attributes and psuedo classes in a selector
-D is equal to the number of (psuedo-)elements in a selector

After calculating the specificity, you know which style rule is going to be applied.

## 4. How I would rate myself
Prior to the project I almost had no CSS experience at all. I think I learned a lot in the last couple of weeks and used my knowledge to build a simple, but responsive and clear restaurant menu not using any classes and ID's. Down below is a rubric of how I would rate myself.

## 6. Closure
Starting with the project, I had (almost) no experience with CSS. This project was a challenge for me, but I think I learned a lot:
- I experimented a lot; what happens if i do this or that. I learned a lot from experimenting with all the different things possible in CSS.
- I learned how to make a responsive website using flexbox.
- I learned how to animate things within CSS
- I learned about progressive enhancement, and how to make a website responsible on all possible platforms and browsers.
- I learned how to make a page interactive using CSS only.
